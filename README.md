    <ul>
    <li><span>What is a binary tree</span></li>
    <small><p> A binary tree is a data structure in which each node has at most two children, called the left child and the right child. The left child of a node is smaller than the node and the right child is greater than the node. Binary trees are used to store data in an ordered way and to perform efficient searches.</p></small>
    
    <li>What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree.</li>
    <small> The difference between a binary tree and a binary search tree is that in a binary search tree, nodes are organized such that smaller nodes are on the left side of the parent node and larger nodes are on the right side of the parent node. In a binary tree, there is no such organization and nodes can be anywhere in the tree</small>
    <li>What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists</li>
    <small>The possible gains in terms of temporal complexity for linked lists and in certain cases the search within their elements will be linear, that is, each element will be searched sequentially one by one. On the other hand, for binary tree elements, other more efficient types of searches could be applied such as binary search, which would give us lower temporal complexities.</small>
    <li>What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
    </li>
    <small>The depth of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf. The height of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf node. The size of a binary tree is the total number of nodes in the tree
    </small>
    <li> What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree</li>
    <small>The different traversal methods to go through a binary tree are: pre-order, in-order and post-order. In pre-order traversal, the root node is visited first, then the left subtree and finally the right subtree. In in-order traversal, the left subtree is visited first, then the root and finally the right subtree. In post-order traversal, the left subtree is visited first, then the right subtree and finally the root
    </small>
    <li> What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree</li>
    <small>A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible. A perfect binary tree is a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level. A balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most one. </small>
